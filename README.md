# Flutter IoT LED Control with Firebase

This repository contains a **Flutter** project for controlling LEDs using **Firebase**. Itâ€™s designed for workshops where participants learn to build a simple IoT system by connecting a Flutter app to a hardware device (like an Arduino or ESP8266) and controlling it via a Firebase backend.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a Flutter app to remotely turn LEDs on and off through an IoT device. The app communicates with Firebase, and the IoT device listens for real-time updates to control the LEDs.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flutter-iot-led-firebase.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd flutter-iot-led-firebase
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Firebase Setup

1. Create a new Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Enable **Realtime Database** in Firebase and set up rules for public access (for demo purposes):
   ```json
   {
     "rules": {
       ".read": "true",
       ".write": "true"
     }
   }
   ```
3. Add your Firebase configuration to the Flutter app by updating the `google-services.json` (for Android) or `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) in the project.

## Running the Project

1. Connect a device or use an emulator.
2. Run the app with the following command:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
3. The app allows you to turn an LED on and off. It sends commands to Firebase, and the IoT device listens for changes to execute the command.
